Project methodology
1) Acquire as much knowledge as possible on the subject
2) Identify the scenarios. Which are the most important and relevant use cases of your application?
3) Once you have identified your use cases, find good, simple, flexible and readable, ready made examples/code 
that grossly implement your use cases. If they achieve what you want and are free, study them and find 
a way to use them in your project.
4) Draw a sequence diagram. Using the knowledge you have acquired in step 1), lay out the most important use cases. 
If you rely on other systems/libraries to create your project, you will need to keep acquiring knowledge about how that 
particular system/library works in order to crete accurate sequence diagrams.
5) Once your sequence diagrams are complete, start by coding your main use case in the simplest and most straightforward,
flexible way possible
