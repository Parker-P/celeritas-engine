 * @brief If the video is still up, this explains it extremely well so you don't have to read:
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gya7x9H3mV0 
 * PBR (Physically Based Rendering) as used in the rendering community, is a way to render models'
 * surfaces in such a way that they closely mimic the way that light and materials interact.
 * The way this is done is by using fairly complex math, although very simple in theory.
 * The main problem we are trying to solve in a fragment shader is that we are trying to caluclate the
 * color of a pixel taking into account all factors that can influence it; although at first it appears
 * a simple problem to solve, there are a lot of factors that influence the color the pixel a surface
 * will have.
 *
 * Lets define the following variables and functions:
 * - x: a pixel of a patch of a mesh (triangle). This is what we are trying to find the color of and is the instance
 *   on which we are running the fragment shader
 * - n: the normal vector of pixel x. Remember that the graphics pipeline on a GPU automatically
 *   interpolates the output variables from the vertex shader to the input variables of the fragment shader.
 *   The GPU does this by running the vertex shader once per vertex. After that, for each triangle (the GPU knows
 *   how to identify triangles because of the index buffer provided in the vertex shader) 
 *   the number of pixels to render is calculated between the vertices by the rasterizer, and for each pixel, a set of weights
 *   is also calculated; these weights specify how close the pixel is to each of the vertices. If the pixel's 
 *   weights are (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), it means that the pixel is exactly half way in between the vertices, therefore
 *   every output variable from each run of the vertex shader on the vertices is exactly the average value of all
 *   3 values for that specific pixel, including the normal vector (if specified as output value in the vertex shader of course).
 *   After that, the fragment shader is run once for each calculated pixel, and the interpolated values are used
 *   as input variables (if specified) in the shader run.
 * - s: the hemisphere above pixel x, whose pole is pointed to exactly by n and whose surface is at exactly 1 unit
 *   distance from x
 * - v: the unit vector pointing from the pixel to the virtual camera
 * - l: the unit vector pointing from the pixel to the light source
 * - BRDF: a function that returns the color and intensity of light reflected by pixel x in direction v, given the
 * - color and intensity of the light source, x and v
 * - Lo: outgoing light color and intensity, represented as a vector of 4 elements with the first 3 elements
 *   being the color defined as RGB values and the 4th element specifying intensity. For example vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0)
 *   defines a red light with an intensity of 15.0
 * - Le: emitted light color and intensity
 * - Li: incoming light color and intensity
 * 
 * With the variables defined above, we can define the PBR equation:
 * Lo = Le + integral over s with differential -l(BRDF * incoming light * DotProduct(n, -l))
 * 
 * We'll go over the BRDF shortly, but first let's dissect and explain this a bit.
 * First of all, we need an integral because we need to sum the light contribution from every single possible direction to pixel x;
 * this is why we are integrating over s with differential -l. The differential is key to understanding this:
 * in the real world, a point in space or on a surface receives light from all possible directions; to calculate this (the light color
 * and intensity), we need the amount of light contributions coming to the point from all possible directions (from the light source to
 * point x). 
 * We defined l as the unit vector that points from pixel x to light source l, so -l is the unit vector that points from the light
 * source to pixel x, but in our case, the entire surface of hemisphere s is also a light source, so we need a way to consider every
 * single point on the hemisphere as a light source; think of an enviroment map that you would use for image-based lighting in Blender
 * for instance.
 * The integral is the perfect way to do this and is literally saying: for each vector -l (pointing from a point on hemishpere s
 * to pixel x) calculate the following (BRDF * Li * DotProduct(n, -l)) and sum it up.
 * The reason why we are using a hemisphere and not an entire sphere (that would consider all possible directions instead of half) 
 * for this calculation is because, in practice, the vast majority of pixels of a surface we are trying to render is surrounded by 
 * other pixels facing the same direction (with the same normal), which would block the light coming from any direction other than
 * the hemisphere above it. 
 * Having now understood the overall structure of how the equation was derived, lets dive into the details:
 * 
 * First of all, we multiply the incoming light Li by DotProduct(n, -l) because we need to scale the light's intensity. The angle of 
 * incidence between -l and normal n is the defining factor; this is because a surface lit from behind receives no direct light rays
 * from the light source, therefore is 100% dark (although in the real world there is always some indirect light reaching it by 
 * bouncing off something else) whereas if the light rays are striking the surface head on, the transmitted energy is at its maximum,
 * because the photons reaching the surface have a much harder time bouncing off of it, so most of their kinetic energy is converted
 * to heat, therefore the surface will be as lit as it can be. The dot product between these 2 vectors gives a scalar value that models this
 * perfectly.
 * 
 * Next, lets dissect the BRDF.
 * BRDF stands for Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function. The value this function calculates represents the amount of light 
 * that is reflected in a specific direction from a light source.
 * This function was derived by Robert Cook and Kenneth Torrance in 1982.
 * To come up with this function, these 2 clever gentlemen started by posing the question: how do we mathematically model the amount
 * of light that reaches our eyes when it bounces off a surface? You can think of a sphere of polished, shiny metal in a bright, sunny summer
 * day; that bright spot on the surface that reflects sunlight towards our eyes: how do we mathematically model the color and intensity
 * of the light that reaches our eyes on that specific point (or area of the surface) with that specific light source (the sun)?
 * 
 * To explain this, we need to introduce some important terminology:
 * 1) Radiant flux: this is simply the total amount of photon energy per second radiated by a light source. Most of the energy a light source emits 
 *    is usually emitted as heat, but we are interested in the energy carried by the photons leaving the light source, and this is what the
 *    radiant flux measures. The energy a photon carries is mostly kinetic energy and is given by (Pc * C) / Wl, where
 *    Pc is Planck's constant, C is light speed in m/s and Wl is the photon's wave length (a.k.a color for us humans) in meters. In this case,
 *    Planck's constant is a way to quantify the mass the photon has (even though photons are mass-less) so we can use it with our existing kinetic 
 *    energy equations for objects that have a mass, although it is much more complicated than that; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant 
 *    for more information.
 * 
 *    The radiant flux is measured in Watts, which corresponds to Joules per second (J/s). Lets break this down: 
 *    One Joule is the work done (or energy expended) by a force of one newton (N) moving an object a distance of one meter (m) in a vacuum where there is no friction. 
 *    One Newton equals a force that produces an acceleration of one meter per second (s) squared on a one kilogram (kg) mass. This means that
 *    applying a constant force of 1 Newton to a 1 Kg object (in a vacuum where there is no friction) will result in the object going 1 meter per 
 *    second faster each second, or it can also mean that applying a force of 1 Newton for 1 second to a 1 Kg object in a vacuum, causes the object to move 1 meter. 
 *    Therefore, one Joule equals one Newton * meter.
 *
 *    To quantify this in a way that you can actually imagine it, imagine being on very smooth, perfectly flat ice (to "simulate" a vacuum), with a 60 Kg, mirror-smooth, cube of 
 *    metal sat on the surface. Now imagine that you have magic shoes that give you perfect grip on the ice; you lean forward, grab the cube from an edge and you push it 
 *    explosively, so that it slides a distance of 1 meter in 1 second. Can you imagine the amount of force you would need to exert with your muscles to do that?
 *    That pushing force you just exerted is roughly the equivalent of 60 Joules, therefore a light emitting 60 Watts of energy is roughly equivalent to the energy
 *    you would expend pushing the 60 Kg cube of metal on ice for one meter each second (from stationary). So you can picture yourself pushing the 60 Kg cube 1 meter 
 *    in one second, then have the cube magically stop, as if it hit an invisible brick wall. You would then approach the stationary cube again and push it 1 meter 
 *    in 1 second again and then have it stop again. This is roughly the equivalent energy required to keep a 60 Watt light on continuously (keep in mind that most energy
 *    emitted will be heat, as photons in general carry very little energy). 
 *    This also gives you an idea of how energetically expensive it is to keep a 1000 watt heater on, for example. It would be like you pushing a 1 ton metal cube on ice from 
 *    stationary for a distance of 1 meter each second, over, and over and over again. Pretty insane...
 * 
 * 2) Radiant intensity: this is the amount of photon energy emitted by a light source in a particular cone. You may have seen spot lights in games, 
 *    where a light illuminates only an exact cone; because this cone is particularly useful, someone gave it a name and also a unit of measurement. 
 *    It is called a solid angle, and it is measured in steradians.
 *    From wikipedia: The steradian (symbol: sr) or square radian is the unit of solid angle in the International System of Units (SI). It is used in 
 *    three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, which quantifies planar angles. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, 
 *    gives a length on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an area on the surface.
 *    So a solid angle is defined by the area on the surface of a sphere projected by a particular cone radiating from the center of the sphere. 
 *    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian for more detailed maths and info.
 *
 *    The unit of measurement for radiant intensity is Watt per steradian, so that would be the amount of energy per second (Watt) emitted in a
 *    particular cone (steradian) around the light source.
 *
 *    A good example that ties radiant flux and radiant intensity together is the point light: what is the radiant intensity of a point light?
 *    How much energy per steradian is emitted by a point light? To calculate it, we simply take the radiant flux of the point light and divide
 *    it by the solid angle in which the photons emitted by the point light travel, which is in all directions. This means that the solid angle
 *    of a point light is not really a cone, it's the entire volume around it, so it's a sphere. The area of a sphere is 4*Pi, so to find the radiant
 *    intensity of a point light, we use (radiant flux / 4*Pi).
 *
 * 3) Irradiance: this is the photon energy received by a surface per area, and is measured in Watts per square meter.
