		// We use the inverse of the camera transformation matrix because this matrix will be applied to each vertex of each object in the scene in the vertex shader.

		// vertices as if they were viewed from the camera, because in the end the physical position of the vertex ends up in the vertex shader, which then calculates
		// its position on 2D screen using the projection matrix.
		// Suppose that our vertex V is at (0,10,0) (so above your head if you are looking down the z axis from the origin)
		// Also suppose that our camera is at (0,0,-10). This means that the camera is behind us by 10 units and can likely see the object
		// somewhat in the upper area of its screen. If we want to see vertex V as if we viewed it from the camera, we would have to move
		// vertex V 10 units forward from its current position. If instead of moving the camera BACK 10 units we move vertex V FORWARD 10 units, 
		// we get the exact same effect as if we actually had a camera and moved it backwards. That's it, very simple idea behind the view matrix.

		// These will be the final coordinates that will be used to place the vertex onto the viewport.
