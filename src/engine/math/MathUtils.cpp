		 * This is an implementation of the Trumbore-Moller ray-triangle intersection algorithm, source paper on the study is under the docs folder.
		 *
		 * In summary, the algorithm is based around the idea of creating a transformation matrix to create a new ad-hoc coordinate system so it's easier
		 * to calculate the point of intersection. In code, this is not apparent, as the algorithm also uses some careful and clever optimizations based on
		 * linear algebra concepts after some careful observations that Trumbore and Moller made when analyzing the math involved.
		 * The paper shows how these optimizations were derived at section 2.5 and 2.6.
		 *
		 * This implementation is copy-pasted from Wikipedia, but it's pretty much exactly the same as the one in the original paper.
