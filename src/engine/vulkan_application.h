	bool window_resized_ = false; //Was the window resized?
	VkInstance instance_; //The instance is our gateway to the vulkan API. The instance is what allows us to use vulkan commands and is the root of the entire Vulkan application context
	VkPhysicalDevice physical_device_; //This is the handle to the actual physical graphics card
	VkDevice logical_device_; //The logical device is an interface that we use to communicate to the physical device
	VkDebugReportCallbackEXT callback_; //Extension callback used for debugging purposes with validation layers
	VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties device_memory_properties_;
	VkSemaphore image_available_semaphore_; //Semaphore used to know when an image is available. Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency between queue operations or between a queue operation and the host (from the Vulkan spec)
	VkSemaphore rendering_finished_semaphore_; //Semaphore used to know when an image has finished rendering. Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency between queue operations or between a queue operation and the host (from the Vulkan spec)
	VkBuffer vertex_buffer_; //The CPU side vertex information of an object
	VkBuffer index_buffer_; //The CPU side face information of an object. An index buffer contains integers that are the corresponding array indices in the vertex buffer. For example if we had 4 vertices and 2 triangles (a quad), the index buffer would look something like {0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3} where the first and last 3 triplets represent a face. Each integer points to the vertex buffer so the GPU knows which vertex to choose from the vertex buffer
	VkDeviceMemory vertex_buffer_memory_; //The GPU side vertex info of an object. This object is filled using the vertex_buffer_ variable
	VkDeviceMemory index_buffer_memory_; //The GPU side face info of an object. This object is filled using the index_buffer_ variable

	VkSwapchainKHR swap_chain_; //This is the object that handles retrieving and updating the images to be displayed. The swapchain decides when to swap the buffers and contains a queue of images to be drawn. The type has the KHR suffix because it is an extension, meaning that it's an optional object that contains pieces of code that enable you to do something that is not native to Vulkan. In this case this extension is provided by Khronos, which also created Vulkan in the first place
	VkSurfaceKHR window_surface_; //This is the object that acts as an interface between the glfw window (in our case) and the swapchain. The type has the KHR suffix because it is an extension, meaning that it's an optional object that contains pieces of code that enable you to do something that is not native to Vulkan. In this case this extension is provided by Khronos, which also created Vulkan in the first place

	std::vector<VkImageView> swap_chain_image_views_; //The interfaces that allow us to know certain information about the images in the swapchain. This information allows us to know how to use the images, it's just metadata
	std::vector<VkFramebuffer> swap_chain_frame_buffers_; //The frame buffers used by the swapchain. A frame buffer is a connection between a render pass and an image.
	VkRenderPass render_pass_;
	VkPipeline graphics_pipeline_; //The graphics pipeline is the entire process of generating an image from the information we are given. It's the process of going fron vertex positions and face information to actual triangles drawn on screen. This object contains all the information needed to do that
	VkPipelineLayout pipeline_layout_;
	VkCommandPool command_pool_; //The command pool is a space of memory that is divided into equally sized blocks and is used to allocate memory for the command buffers. The command buffers contain vulkan commands such as to allocate buffer memory, begin a render pass or draw an image
	std::vector<VkCommandBuffer> graphics_command_buffers_; //A command buffer contains pre recorded vulkan commands. These commands are recorded in this object then put onto a logical device queue. Vulkan will then tell the GPU to execute them in order.

	uint32_t present_queue_family_; //A queue family is a category of queue. Queues within a single family are considered compatible with one another, and work produced for a family of queues can be executed on any queue within that family
	VkQueue graphics_queue_; //This is the actual queue to process graphics commands
