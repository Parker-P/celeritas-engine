		 * @param usageFlags This tells Vulkan what's the buffer's intended use.

		 * 2) VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT: this means that the CPU will be able to read and write from the allocated memory IF YOU CALL vkMapMemory() FIRST.
		 * 3) VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT: this means that the memory will be cached so that when the CPU writes to this buffer, if the data is small enough to fit in its
		 * cache (which is much faster to access) it will do that instead. Only problem is that this way, if your GPU needs to access that data, it won't be able to unless it's

		 * granting the GPU access to the CPU's cache (if the buffer is also marked as HOST_CACHED). COHERENT stands for consistency across memories, so it basically means 
		 * that the CPU, GPU or any other device will see the same memory if trying to access the buffer. If you don't have this flag set, and you try to access the 
		 * buffer from the GPU while the buffer is marked HOST_CACHED, you may not be able to get the data or even worse, you may end up reading the wrong chunk of memory.

		/**
		 * @brief The graphics pipeline represents, at the logical level, the entire process
		 * of inputting vertices, indices and textures into the GPU and getting a 2D image that represents the scene
		 * passed in out of it. In early GPUs, this process was hardwired into the graphics chip, but as technology improved and needs 
		 * for better and more complex graphics increased, GPU producers have taken steps to make this a much more programmable
		 * and CPU-like process, so much so that technologies like CUDA (Compute Uniform Device Architecture) have come out.
		 * 
		 * Nowadays the typical GPU consists of an array of clusters of microprocessors, where each micro
		 * processor is highly multithreaded, and its ALU and instruction set (thus its circuitry) optimized for operating on 
		 * floating point numbers, vectors and matrices (as that is what is used to represent coordinates in space and space transformations).
		 * 
		 * CUDA is the result of NVidia and Microsoft working together to improve the programmers' experience for programming
		 * shaders; the result is a product that maps C/C++ instructions to the GPU's ALUs instruction set, to take full advantage
		 * of the GPU's high amount of cores and threads. By doing this, things like crypto mining and machine learning have gotten
		 * a huge boost, as the data that requires manipulation is very loosely coupled (has very few dependecies on the data in
		 * the same set) and, as a result, can be processed by many independent threads simultaneously. This is called a compute pipeline.
		 * 
		 * Khronos, the developers of the Vulkan API, have also done something similar called OpenCL, the compute side of OpenGL.
		 * The typical graphics (or render) pipeline consists of programmable, configurable and hardwired stages, where:
		 * a) The programmable stages are custom stages that will be run on the GPU's multi-purpose array of microprocessors using a program (a.k.a shader).
		 * b) The configurable stages are hardwired stages that can perform their task a different way based on user configuration via calls to the Vulkan API.
		 * c) The hardwired stages are immutable stages that cannot be changed unless manipulating the hardware.
		 * The graph of a typical graphics pipeline is shown under docs/GraphicsPipeline.svg (image from Wikipedia).
		 * 
		 * More on the programmable stages:
		 * The programmable stages are the flexible stages that the programmer can fully customize by writing little programs called shaders.
		 * These shader programs will run:
		 * 1) once per vertex in the case of the vertex shader; this shader program's goal is to take vertex attrbutes in, and output
		 * a vertex color and 2D position (more precisely, a 3D position inside of the Vulkan's coordinate range, which is -1 to 1 for X and Y and 0 to 1 for Z).
		 * 2) once per pixel in the case of the fragment shader; this stage's goal is to take the rasterizer's output (which is a hardwired
		 * stage on the GPU chip as of 2022, whose goal is to color pixels based on vertex colors) and textures, and output a colored pixel based on
		 * the color of the textures and other variables such as direct and indirect lighting.
		 * There are other shader stages, but the 2 above are the strictly needed shaders in order to be able to render something.

		 * This type of execution flow has a name and is called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), as the same program (single instruction) 
		 * is run independently on different cores/threads for multiple vertices or pixels (multiple data).
		 * 
		 * Examples of the configurable stages are anti-aliasing and tessellation.
		 * Examples of hardwired stages are backface-culling, depth testing and alpha blending.

		 * Based on the normal vector, the vertex shader can perform lighting calculations by computing
		 * the angle between the source of the light and the normal.
