	/**
	 * @brief A descriptor is a block of data, similar to a buffer, with the difference being that a descriptor is bound to metadata
	 * that Vulkan uses to enable their use in the shaders of a pipeline. This allows us to exchange data between a program run by the CPU's cores with a shader run
	 * by the GPU's cores.
	 * A descriptor is accessed by a shader by using an index and a binding number, similar to vertex attributes, which are accessed
	 * by the vertex shader using a binding and a location number.
	 * For example, in a shader, a descriptor is declared as follows:
	 *
	 * #version 450
	 *
	 * // Descriptor declaration. The shader will access the descriptor with binding number 1 at descriptor set with index 2.
	 * layout(set = 2, binding = 1) uniform UniformBuffer
	 * {
	 *     ... data in the uniform buffer ...
	 * } uniformBuffer;
	 *
	 * void main()
	 * {
	 *		... shader code that uses uniformBuffer...
	 * }
	 *
	 * See the _bindingNumber member, and the _indexNumber member in the DescriptorSet class.
