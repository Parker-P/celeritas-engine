		 * @brief The graphics pipeline represents, at the logical level, the entire process
		 * of inputting vertices, indices and textures into the GPU and getting a 2D image that represents the scene
		 * passed in out of it. In early GPUs, this process was hardwired into the graphics chip, but as technology improved and needs
		 * for better and more complex graphics increased, GPU producers have taken steps to make this a much more programmable
		 * and CPU-like process, so much so that technologies like CUDA (Compute Uniform Device Architecture) have come out.
		 *
		 * Nowadays the typical GPU consists of an array of clusters of microprocessors, where each micro
		 * processor is highly multithreaded, and its ALU and instruction set (thus its circuitry) optimized for operating on
		 * floating point numbers, vectors and matrices (as that is what is used to represent coordinates in space and space transformations).
		 *
		 * CUDA is the result of NVidia and Microsoft working together to improve the programmers' experience for programming
		 * shaders; the result is a product that maps C/C++ instructions to the GPU's ALUs instruction set, to take full advantage
		 * of the GPU's high amount of cores and threads. By doing this, things like crypto mining and machine learning have gotten
		 * a huge boost, as the data that requires manipulation is very loosely coupled (has very few dependecies on the data in
		 * the same set) and, as a result, can be processed by many independent threads simultaneously. This is called a compute pipeline.
		 * Khronos, the developers of the Vulkan API, have also done something similar called OpenCL, the compute side of OpenGL.
		 *
		 * The typical graphics (or render) pipeline consists of programmable, configurable and hardwired stages, where:
		 * a) The programmable stages are custom stages that will be run on the GPU's multi-purpose array of microprocessors using a program (a.k.a shader).
		 * b) The configurable stages are hardwired stages that can perform their task a different way based on user configuration via calls to the Vulkan API.
		 * c) The hardwired stages are immutable stages that cannot be changed unless manipulating the hardware.
		 * The graph of a typical graphics pipeline is shown under docs/GraphicsPipeline.jpg.
		 *
		 * More on the programmable stages:
		 * The programmable stages are the flexible stages that the programmer can fully customize by writing little programs called shaders.
		 * These shader programs will run:
		 * 1) once per vertex in the case of the vertex shader; this shader program's goal is to take vertex attrbutes in, and output
		 * a vertex color and 2D position (more precisely, a 3D position inside of the Vulkan's coordinate range, which is -1 to 1 for X and Y and 0 to 1 for Z).
		 * 2) once per pixel in the case of the fragment shader; this stage's goal is to take the rasterizer's output (which is a hardwired
		 * stage on the GPU chip as of 2022, whose goal is to color pixels based on vertex colors) and textures, and output a colored pixel based on
		 * the color of the textures and other variables such as direct and indirect lighting.
		 * There are other shader stages, but the 2 above are the strictly needed shaders in order to be able to render something.

		 * This type of execution flow has a name and is called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), as the same program (single instruction)
		 * is run independently on different cores/threads for multiple vertices or pixels (multiple data).
		 *
		 * Examples of the configurable stages are anti-aliasing and tessellation.
		 * Examples of hardwired stages are backface-culling, depth testing and alpha blending.
		 *
		 * For a good overall hardware and software explanation of a typical NVidia GPU, see
		 * https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-iv-general-purpose-computation-gpus-primer/chapter-30-geforce-6-series-gpu
