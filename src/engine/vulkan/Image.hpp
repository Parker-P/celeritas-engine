         * Say you have an image which is actually a fairly large atlas of many individual images.
         * You could use an image view to represent a single mip level, or maybe a small region of the atlas, or both,
         * or the whole thing. The point of the abstraction is it allows you to alias the access of an image without
         * needing to muck with the image itself. Think of it as a lens for viewing the image.
         * If you're familiar with C++, this is similar to the string_view concept where you act on ranges of the
         * string without tampering with the source data itself.
